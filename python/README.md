Your task is to:
Fork the github repo and commit your changes as you would on any regular project. Please use the main branch. 

The code should be able to run with python 3.10+.

Improve the current code by extending the implementation of the tests.

Write down a list of aspects you find worth improving regarding the design and the implementation of the current project. 

Send us this list via e-mail along with the link to your repository.


## Technical Interview
For your overview, in the technical interview, we will then discuss the solutions in the first part of the interview. In the second part be prepared to discuss what architecture or what architecture options can be applied to implement the supermarket receipt service in a cloud-based micro-service environment. It will be an open discussion elaborating the pros and cons of different solutions and possible implications
